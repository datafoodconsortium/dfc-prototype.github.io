# Goal

The goal of this repo is to host the work on the Data Food Consortium prototype.

## Develop

The client app uses node modules and is bundled with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

```
# install dependencies
npm install

# bundle with parcel
npm start

# browse!
xdg-open http://localhost:1234
```
